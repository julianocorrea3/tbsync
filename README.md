# Provider-4-TbSync

This repository can be used to create a TbSync provider add-on for Thunderbird. A TbSync provider add-on adds further sync capabilities to TbSync.

Just clone this repository or use the GitHub template function to create a new repository in your own GitHub account and than clone that.

After you have all the files on disc, run
```
./setup.py
```
which will ask you a couple of questions to setup the provider add-on for you. After that, head over to
```
https://tbsync.readthedocs.io/
```
to get used to the TbSync Provider API and how to add your own sync code.
