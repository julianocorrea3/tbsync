Generating a Basic TbSync Provider Add-on
-----------------------------------------

Head over to

::

  https://github.com/jobisoft/Provider-4-TbSync
 
and clone the provider add-on template repository. If you have a GitHub account yourself, you can simply `add a copy of the provider add-on template to your own account <https://github.com/jobisoft/Provider-4-TbSync/generate>`_.

After you have all the files on disc, run

::

  ./setup.py

which will ask you a couple of questions to setup the provider add-on for you. After that is done, you can install your own provider add-on in Thunderbird 68. Just zip the project folder and install the file using the gear menu in the Thunderbird add-on manager:

To see your own provider add-on in action, you need to install the latest version of TbSync from the so called *beta release channel* for Thunderbird 68.

::

  https://github.com/jobisoft/TbSync/wiki/Get-the-latest-TbSync-version#beta-release-channel
 
Please make sure, that you uninstall any other TbSync provider add-on or switch to their version from the *beta release channel* as well. Your own provider add-on should then show up in the "Add new account" menu of TbSync:

Once your TbSync provider add-on is stable and released to `addons.thunderbird.net <https://addons.thunderbird.net>`_, it can be added as a standard entry to the "Add new account" menu of TbSync, so all TbSync users will learn about it and get directed to its add-on page. For example this is what users see, when they try to create an *ActiveSync* account, but the provider add-on for *ActiveSync* is not yet installed:

Directory Structure of the Generated Provider Add-on
----------------------------------------------------

These are the important files and folders of the generated provider add-on:

::

    ├── bootstrap.js
    ├── chrome.manifest
    ├── manifest.json
    ├── _locales
    │   └── en-US
    │       ├── messages.json

            ├── editAccountOverlay.js
            └── editAccountOverlay.xul

The author suggests to not rename files or folders, to not break the add-on. The following list provides an overview:

bootstrap.js
  This file is registering your provider add-on with TbSync. The generated file should work out of the box.

manifest.json
  The main configuration file for your add-on. Further details about this file can be found in the `MDN documentation <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json>`_. The generated file should work out of the box.

chrome.manifest
  An additional configuration file for your add-on. You probably only have to change it, when adding further translations (locales).

_locales
  Folder containing files to translate your add-on into different languages. Add a subfolder for each language and register them in ``chrome.manifest``. The name of the folder must not be changed.

  en-US/messages.json
    Localization for entries in ``manifest.json``. Check the `MDN documentation <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Internationalization#Internationalizing_manifest.json>`_ for more details. The name of the file must not be changed.

  en-US/provider.strings
    Localization for your add-on, which can be accessed from JavaScript. The name of the file may be anything you like, but it must be announced via :class:`Base.getStringBundleUrl` as TbSync needs to access some of your localized strings. In paticular error messages and synchronization states your add-on is using.

  en-US/provider.dtd
    Deprecated localization for XUL files of your add-on. Try to avoid its usage and instead set the localized labels of XUL/HTML elements via JavaScript. The generated provider add-on is using this in ``createAccount.xul`` and ``editAccountOverlay.xul``.
  
skin
  Folder containing all your additional resources like images and CSS files. It exists for historical reasons and the author is used to that approach. The generated provider add-on also stores its logo files there. If you change their names, please also update your `manifest.json <https://github.com/jobisoft/Provider-4-TbSync/blob/ebfeec7b714baf956703511e30656208c8375526/manifest.json#L16>`_ and your implementation of :class:`Base.getProviderIcon`. 

content
  Folder containing your add-ons source files.
   
  provider.js
    File containing your implementation of the :class:`Base` class and a few other classes, depending on what your add-on is supposed to do. See :doc:`implementing` for more details.
   
  manager
    Folder containing resources used be the manager UI. In paticular the XUL file for the *Create new account* dialog of your provider add-on (see :class:`Base.getCreateAccountWindowUrl`) and the XUL file containing your tabs for the *Edit account dialog* (see :class:`Base.getEditAccountOverlayUrl`).
